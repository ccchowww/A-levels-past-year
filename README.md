Alternative front-end for gceguide CIE A Levels papers.

Built with React and Material UI.

# Issues that lead to this project
- Finding past papers during my first year of CIE A Levels was frustrating and time consuming.
- I found that "https://www.gceguide.com/" had the most complete collection of past papers,
  but lacked a student-friendly search method.


# Goals for this project
- Minimize time from opening the browser to reaching a past paper.
- Let other students know of this wonderful time-saver.

From the thoughts and criticisms of my classmates,

Additional feature: Link to all past papers from the Selected Subject.
